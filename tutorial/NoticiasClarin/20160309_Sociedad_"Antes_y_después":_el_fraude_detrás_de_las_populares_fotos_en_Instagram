Si hacemos un repaso a nuestro timeline de Instagram es más probable que veamos chicas con cuerpos bonitos y en poses sexies que panzas. Pero un movimiento que corre por esa red social, bajo el hashtag #30secondsbeforeandafter, pretende desenmascarar un fenómeno en el que se consigue exhibir un cuerpo estupendo en muy poco tiempo, cuando en realidad no es tan fácil como parece. En sólo 30 segundos, sin necesidad de pasar por el gym o hacer dieta, se pueden mostrar dos versiones bastante diferentes de tu cuerpo. Y el truco está en la pose.  ⚡️ not a transformation photo ⚡️ A while back I saw the super awesome @workoutbean post about the #30secondbeforeandafter photo to keep it real and I thought it was deffo worth having a go 😎  So both of these photos were taken tonight at 10:30pm - the left photo is sticking my legs together, abs completely relaxed and then the right is standing up straighter and flexin 😝 I suppose what these before and after pictures show me is that Instagram doesn't always tell the whoooole story. We decide what we choose to share and most of the time we share the stuff that we feel good about but I guess it's important to realise that everyone has struggles along their journey and that's totally ok and normal 😊 I mean I sure wish the right picture was just my natural look 😂 but I love the picture on the left just as much ☺️ (even with my sticky out rib😂) Thanks Jera for making such an awesome tag 😘 #thekaylamovement #kaylasarmy #kaylaitsines #kayla_itsines #bbg #bbgfam #bbgcommunity #bbgsisters #bikinibodyguide Una foto publicada por BBG Week 6️⃣2️⃣ (@helbbg) el 16 de Dic de 2015 a la(s) 2:46 PST Mirá también: Belleza XL, el modelo que impuso la “chica del verano” La usuaria @workoutbean empezó este movimiento haciendo la propuesta a sus seguidoras de sacarse una foto del antes y el después con un intervalo de 30 segundo por medio. Esconder la barriga, separar un poco las piernas, sacar pecho y poner recta la espalda, y hasta ponerse unos tacones, pueden ser una buena solución para que el cuerpo cambie bastante entre una foto y otra. Sin necesidad de dietas extremas ni horas y horas en el gimnasio, como muchas aseguran hacer en sus supuestos cambios radicales.  A small step every day towards positive change is better than no steps at all. Whether you're working on your body, your mind, your career... set aside some time every day, or every other day to work on something that makes you happy.  I always see various memes and quotes floating around, and one that always has stuck with me is "three months from now, you will wish you had started today." It's been almost a year since I've started making major changes in my life- not just to my health and physical appearance, but my career as well, and I can't tell you how thankful I am I didn't start one day later than I did. There is no "best time" to start something. Don't wait till tomorrow or until when you feel like it. Start today and don't look back. #transformationtuesday Una foto publicada por Jera (@workoutbean) el 8 de Mar de 2016 a la(s) 2:29 PST Jara, la creadora del ##30secondbeforeandafter Mirá también: Bajó 35 kilos, su marido le pidió el divorcio y es furor en Instagram Esta movida en la red es para luchar contra las personas que hablan de los cambios radicales que consiguen en tiempo récord. Eso no existe, para perder peso o ponerse en forma hace falta seguir unas pautas, con las que raramente en 15 días van a conseguir resultados tan extremos como los que en ocasiones se muestran en redes sociales. Esto tiene un aspecto muy negativo, ya que se juega con la salud de las personas. Precisamente por esto ha nacido la iniciativa, para acabar con este engaño.

I do NOT have abs. I have them under a little cushion that I love but I can only make them come out when I flexxxx. normally I'm just relaxed and chillllllin and you know what? #inthismomentilovemybody and in every moment I do. I can't believe I'm on week 12 this week!!! and beautiful babes @helbbg @buffs_do_bbg @annadohuynh and @leangreenbbgmachine tagged me for #morningabs and this is it! flexed and relaxed. just a 30 second difference and I love myself in both :) Una foto publicada por one happy soul ✌🌻 (@peaceofkelly) el 9 de Nov de 2015 a la(s) 6:08 PST  ❌THIS IS NOT A TRANSFORMATION PHOTO❌ I've jumped on the #30secondbeforeandafter 🕐 challenge and have decided after much hesitation to share this photo. In the photo on the left I am tilting my pelvis forward, bloating my stomach as much as possible (btw I've got mad bloating skills), hunching my shoulders and slumping. In the photo on the right, I'm standing tall, I'm flexing my stomach, my spine is in proper alignment. Girls, for me this photo really reaffirmed how important it is to take your progress photos with the same posture, lighting, etc. It's not about how big of a transformation you've had. It's not about how skinny you appear to be or how heavy you were when you started your journey. It's not about how you compare to other girls who are on the same week as you. I'll tell you what it IS about: strength, integrity, fortitude--things we strive for each and every day that we wake up and choose to be honest with others, but first and foremost, honest with ourselves about our insecurities, our hopes, our struggles, our triumphs. At first this picture embarrassed me. I wasn't going to share it and I've hung onto it for days debating. I'm doing it now because it's REAL. So jump on the bandwagon or don't--either way, let's work together to keep this community transparent and goal driven! #transformationtuesday #not #honest Una foto publicada por Cristina + Lexie (@buffs_do_bbg) el 10 de Nov de 2015 a la(s) 6:19 PST  ⚡⚡️⚡⚡️️️JOIN THE CHALLENGE! Use hashtag #30secondbeforeandafter ⚡⚡⚡️️⚡️️ 🕐 these photos were taken seconds apart 🕓 this is NOT a before and after ❌ For #transformationtuesday, I'm sharing another 30 second before and after to show the power that images have and our ability to filter what we show the public. ▫️Left image: bad posture, sticking stomach out, pushing legs together. ▫️Right image: standing up straight, flexing stomach, pushing thighs apart. ▫️We create our own visual identity. We decide what to project to the rest of the world. Yes, it's great to show the highlight reel when we've achieved our goals or have mornings abs to flex, but it's important to share the struggles too. I think we all can connect with one another more when we realize that we all have our own challenges and bumps in the road! But I digress... I think we should all #keepitreal every now and again, so join the #30secondbeforeandafter tribe and show us what you've got! Una foto publicada por Jera (@workoutbean) el 1 de Dic de 2015 a la(s) 1:54 PST  I'm just about to run out the door so didn't have time to put the pics together but I wanted to join in the #30secondbeforeandafter challenge started by jera @workoutbean  This is me flexing to pushing my tummy out.. Which believe me is not hard to do 😁 Mines not quite 30secs between more like 4secs but just goes to show how images can be deceiving. Un vídeo publicado por Nikki Rees | BBG | Wk 43 (@activelyrees) el 7 de Nov de 2015 a la(s) 5:15 PST  **THIS IS NOT A TRANSFORMATION PIC** I'm joining in on @workoutbean's #30secondbeforeandafter challenge. As it suggests, these pictures were taken seconds apart, using different postures and sticking my stomach out and legs together (left) and flexing and stretching my torso (right). I always try to keep it real with you guys, but this challenge is a good reminder that pictures can be deceiving and people show what they want to show!!! I hope more people will join in this challenge 💪🏼 Let's keep it honest, ladies! #tgif #flexfriday #bbg #bbggirls #bbgfam #bbgcommunity #kaylasarmy #kaylaitsines #kayla_itsines #fitness #fitfam #strongnotskinny #girlswholift #girlswithmuscle #chickswholift #workout #exercise #health #bikinibodyguide #strongissexy #bbgsisters Una foto publicada por Michelle (@healthyhappymichelle) el 13 de Nov de 2015 a la(s) 3:23 PST  **NOT A PROGRESS PHOTO** #flashbackfriday to 30seconds ago...posture makes all the difference 😉 I have had a few people message out of concern for my weight please know I am  also guilty of flexing and using posture to achieve my #fitspo pics. #30secondbeforeandafter #transformation #beforeandafter #progress Una foto publicada por K E L L Y • H O C K E Y (@kellyhockey) el 25 de Feb de 2016 a la(s) 9:06 PST  ⚡⚡ NOT a progress picture ⚡⚡So, I was stretching after #bbgweek16 abs tonight and my post chocolate-covered raisin/popcorn/sushi/beer belly was rolling over the top of my leggings and my hubby said laughing "You should post THAT on your instagram". And he's right. 😂 I do NOT walk around with superwoman abs all day and I don't know if I ever will. What I DO know is, both of the girls in this picture did 200 mountain climbers today. Both girls did 80 toe touches. Both girls ate lots of yummy goodness and regretted nothing. I love both of these bellies! 😄 I first saw the #30secondbeforeandafter tag by Jera @workoutbean (one of my all time favorite accounts) several weeks ago and this is my third post. The message behind it: don't get caught up or discouraged by comparing your body/progress/life with others through social media. Lighting, poses, flexing can make all the difference. Social media can be an amaaaazing source of community and inspo, BUT the important thing is that we stay hungry, work hard, support eachother, and together, we can do anything. #bbgfamily #bbgforlife #bodypositive #womenempoweringwomen Una foto publicada por Natalie | BBG | 27 Weeks (@spikyfit) el 5 de Feb de 2016 a la(s) 11:18 PST  #30secondbeforeandafter Muchas personas se comparan con otras a las que ni si quiera conocen, no saben nada sobre sus vidas ni cómo son físicamente en realidad y esto crea complejos. Estas fotografías están hechas con escasos minutos de diferencia, en la izquierda salgo sacando tripa, con una posición vaga y mala cara, en la derecha salgo erguida, enseñando tatuajes y con cara chupi guay. Porque no es oro todo lo que reluce y en internet, menos. Una foto publicada por Adri Chelsea Smile (@_hecate__) el 29 de Feb de 2016 a la(s) 1:08 PST  Taken same day.
